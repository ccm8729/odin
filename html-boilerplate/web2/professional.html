            My career path hasn't been one of standard progression.  Since graduating university in 2014, I've worked on databases, arranged imports of tens of millions of dollars worth of materials, forecasted and acted upon customer demand, designed new warehouses, and been a deciding voice on the design and implimentation of more than one ERP system.  Here, you can find the details of each position I've had.  Feel free to write me using the link on the sidebar or the contact form if you have questions or want more details!

            Immediately after graduating college, I began an internship at EDMC as a database administration intern.  The duties of this position were pretty simple - I was given spescs for a SQL query to follow, and would write that query out.  It often times turned into a stored procedure, or was otherwise run on a schedule and delivered automatically to report consumers at specfiic times each day. However, this position was only temporary, for a contracted 6 month period.  At the end of the contract, due to financial restraints in the company, I was not hired full time from the internship.

            Once leaving EDMC, I began work at a new company - Manuli Hydraulics.  Manuli manufactures hydraulic hose and fittings.  For example, you'll see these types of products on construction equipment, farm equipment, in factories, etc...  My responsiblities in this new position were to organize freight shipments from overseas warehouses and factories into our US branches.  This involved the actual shipment details, but also how the shipments clear customs, and ensuring accuracy upon delivery.  In addition, it was my responsiblity to organize the annual invenntory at our North American warehosues.  During this position, there was a lot of opportunity for automation to be put into place - so I did so.  Automating reports, importing data into the database instead of manually typing it, etc.  The position was largely data entry when I entered it, and had become mostly automated by the time I was promoted.

            Upon my promotion at Manuli, my job title became Supply Chain Manager.  This job was much more involved - not only did I now have direct reports, but I was expected to forecast exact quantities of products that would be used by both new and existing customers.  In addition, it was my responsibility to lead a team related to ERP changes - implimenting new ERP's, it was my responsibility to understand the requirements of the all business units, and work those into test cases for new potential ERP solutions.  Also, developing training documentation, and completing both in person and virtual training for end users prior to implimentation of the new ERP systems.

            Most recently, my career took me to Teknor Apex.  As a remote systems analyst, it was my responsibility to understand the workflow of employees working on the logsitical side of the business, and design, modify, and test the ERP system in ways which would benefit the business.  The main goal of my time at Teknor was the implimentation of a new ERP system (infor M3 cloud), across all locations of the company globally.  This project spanned almost 30 warehouses, factories, and office locations, taking place in 6 countries.   It was my responsibility to determine gaps in the new 'cloud' ERP, and design technical specifications to close those gaps.  This includes how the users would interface with the new modification, how the modification would interface with the databases, what triggers should kick of which events, etc.  It was also my responsibility to QA test the modifications once they were returned from programmers, and train users on how the changes will affect them upon implimentation.

            Next in my career? Who knows. I'm actively seeking employment within Germany.  I have many skills that might be relevant to a new career path, including:
            <ul>
                <li>developing requirements for ERP implimentation/modifications</li>
                <li>identifying test cases for new system modifications</li>
                <li>end user training</li>
                <li>The basics of HTML/CSS, as demonstrated by this website</li>
                <li>an effective communicator with peers, superiors, and consumers of our software.</li>
                <li>A demonstrated ability to learn quickly and multitask</li>
            </ul>
            I would love if you would be the next step in my journey through this career!
