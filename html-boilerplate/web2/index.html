        Hey, thanks for visiting! I'm Chris, 31 years old and currently living in Heidelberg, Germany.  This page is designed to introduce you to me a little, as well as demonstrate my skills as I learn more about HTML, CSS, and JS.  Please note as you look around that everything here was designed by me, without the use of automated tools to assist in development (i.e., wordpress, etc.).  I'm happy to share the source code upon reqeust as demonstration!  I've just started to learn in September, so it's simple, but something I'm proud of!
        <br><br>
        My life currently is one of change.  I'm new to Germany, Heidelberg, and German culture, having arrived here on the 1st of November, 2023.  Actively seeking a new job, new friends, and hobbies as I build a life far away from my home in Pittsburgh, USA.
        <br><br>
        Please see more about my professional development in the 'professional' section below, or in the link on the sidebar at the left.  Also, I love to travel! I've been lucky enough to have space and time to explore a large part of the world that interests me.  You can see more about that under the 'travel' heading and links.  
        <br><br>
        Feel free to email me, check my LinkedIn, or similar with feedback, questions, or just to say hello :)

        <h3 class="prohead">My career at a glance</h3><br><br>
        Recently, I've been doing work as a business analyst - working for Teknor Apex, I was gathering requirements for modifications to an ERP called Infor M3, then putting those requirements into a specification for the purpose of guiding programmers as they develop this modification.  Everything from how the modification should look, to how it should interact with the database, what test cases should pass vs. error, etc. I enjoyed this job greatly, and excelled at it - however, I decided to leave this job with the explicit intention of moving to Germany, to pursue a lifestyle more suited to my tastes.
        <br><br>
        In the past, my career had a mixed focus on supply chain management and QA testing/requirements development for new ERP implimentations across multiple business units of Manuli Hydraulics.  My focus varied here, from how to forecast demand for new/existing businesses, to determining whether ERP functionality would fit the business process of the company.  
        <br><br>
        I'm happy to provide contact information for any of the positions in my history - I excelled within each position, and my previous managers would all be happy to speak to you in detail regarding specific duties, competencies, skills, etc.  And of course, you can find more details at the 'professional' link on the sidebar.

        <br><br>
        I've always had a passion for travel.  And I've been quite lucky with my ability to travel - I've seen quite a bit of the world, and maintain a strong desire to see more!  I wanted to add this section so you can enjoy some of the pictures I've taken through my travels.  It also gives me a space to demonstrate additional functionality in HTML/JS/CSS to format and dsiplay this type of information!
        <br><br>
        My travels have been focused on North America, as well as Europe.  Some of the places I've been that I've enjoyed most are:
        <ul class="tralist">
            <li>Venice</li>
            <li>Krakow</li>
            <li>Sedona, Arizona</li>
            <li>Paris</li>
        </ul>
        
        Of course, I've had the pleasure to travel to locations I've enjoyed not so much also:
        <ul class="tralist">
            <li>Las Angeles</li>
            <li>Morgantown, Wv</li>
            <li>Manchester, UK</li>
            <li>Houston, TX</li>
        </ul>
        See more information and pictures under the travel link!
